## Overview and Origin

### Name of company
Opendoor is one of the top fintech companies in America with a $3.8 billion valuation.  In fact it was recently ranked by Forbes as one of the top ten US fintech companies for 2020.

### When was the company incorporated?
Opendoor was incorporated in 2014.  Its co-founders are Eric Wu and Ian Wong who currently hold the titles of CEO and CTO respectively. 

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The co-founders, Wu and Wong, set out to provide a radically simplified way a person can sell/buy a home. Drastically changing the home selling/buying model helps homeowners complete one of the most important decisions an adult will make.  Whether dictated by life changing events or a carefully planned move, Opendoor has make this process much easier. 

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Opendoor has funding that includes a fully committed PIPE of $600 million and up to $414 million of cash held in the trust account of Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. II (“SCH”).  With the sale of nearly 19,000 homes in 2019 alone Opendoor amassed revenue of $4.7 billion.  In the six short years since its founding, it has over 80,000 customers and over $10 billion in home sales.

## Business Activities

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Opendoor can provided customers with a better experience by simplifying the real estate process and by reducing time on the market and costs.  Customers can save in closing costs, unintended costs and by saving time, the seller can save several months of mortgage payments that they would have had to pay while waiting for their house to sell.

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Opendoor's intended customer is anyone who needs to buy or sell a house.  Currently over 60% of Americans are homeowners and 89% of buyers and sellers use an agent and follow the traditional buying/selling process making them would-be customers.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Opendoor drastically simplifies and speeds up the closing process in both buying and selling. Typically a person must find an agent, fix up the property, list it, have showings and open houses, negotiate offers, get the property inspected and potentially negotiate repairs. There can be offers and counter-offers and in many cases the deal will fall through due to timing uncertainties and the inability for the buyer to meet financial obligations when it comes to financing.  The entire process can usually take up to three months or more. With Opendoor, the seller can sell on his or her terms with a guaranteed cash offer and closing time in as little as three days.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Opendoor operates digitally using a web-based and app platform. The user can navigate to them, provide some brief information about the property they wish to sell and receive an offer within 24 hours.

## Landscape

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Opendoor operates in the Mortgage/Real Estate domain of the financial industry. More specifically, Opendoor is an iBuyer company where the entire home buying/selling transactions from start to close can be done digitally.

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
The previous 5-10 years in real estate has been primarily that of growth as the sector recovered from the 2008/2009 recession.  As we recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, real estate markets are expected to make a full recovery and return to the pre-pandemic boom we've been experiencing over the last decade.  How municipalities are able to recover individually from the pandemic will be indicative on how well and how fast they each return to those boom levels.

### What are the other major companies in this domain?
All Mortgage/Real Estate companies fall under the general domain but Offerpad, Zillow Offers, Knock, RedfinNow and Realogy are the other leading iBuyers.


## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Opendoor has made waves in the $1.6 trillion real estate industry and in six short years has commanded nearly a 5% market share of the industry.

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Companies in the iBuyer domain look to reduce costs across the board and increase net proceeds for the sellers, thereby increasing the number of homes that are sold through their service.

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Opendoor is the leading iBuyer company in the United States with nearly 4.5 times the homes sold of its nearest competitor.  As of 2019 in Phoenix, AZ (the largest market for iBuyers), Opendoor dominated with nearly half of all the home sales in the iBuyers domain.


## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Perhaps in markets where they have less penetration, Opendoor might tweak their fees to be more competitive against traditional real estate companies.  Although Opendoor is very competitive when compared to the other iBuyer companies, sellers tend to leave some money on the table when comparing selling their house on the open market.  For example, with a $270,000, as much as $7,500 might be left on the table as a trade off for convenience versus selling on the open market.  There is a lot of potential growth in this space. The company might also tweak their advertising so that more people are aware of them early in the selling process. This could potentially lead to growth in existing markets as well as open the door for future markets. Currently Opendoor only operates in 21 real estate markets.

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Naturally, bringing in new customers through more advertisement will give them a greater pool of customers from which many will convert once they perceive the benefits.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Opendoor would utilize existing technologies for these improvements. Any fee modifications would be displayed on the digital platforms and advertisement on existing media.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Making the company more competitive to other iBuyer companies and traditional real estate companies alike is a win-win for Opendoor and more focused advertisement will definitely bring in more customers.
